This repository contains data and R code used for studies as part of my PhD titled "VetCompass eClinical Trials (VETs) â€“ Generating Interventional Evidence from Observational Data"
The files "230913_CCL_Target_Trial_Open_Access" and "230913_CCL_Target_Trial_Open_Access" provide the data and R code used to answer the research question: 
"Does surgical versus non-surgical management of cranial cruciate ligament rupture in dogs cause different outcomes?"
The study used Target Trial Emulation and included dogs diagnosed with CCL rupture between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019 within the VetCompass database
Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to adjust for confounding
